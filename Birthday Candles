Logic:- 

    static int birthdayCakeCandles(int[] ar) {
           int count=0, num = 0;
           for(int i =0;i<ar.length;i++){
              if(ar[i]>num){
                  num=ar[i];
                  count =1;
              }else if(ar[i]==num){
                  count++;
              }
              
           }
        return count;
    }
